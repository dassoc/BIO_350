# BIO_350
first one idk
starting out BIO350 assignments repo

IC Assignment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook
- making a difference equation
-technical difficulties
-it worked thank god

IC_assignment 2: chapter 2 of ecology handbook
-making an exponential equation
-so many technical difficulties
just coppied enya
did matplotlib adn plotting on x and y axis

IC-in class
did a log on the previous assignmetn 
then did if for function
messed aroudn with the graph of that

IC_assignment3
created a logistic model for the chances of plants gowing after lanslide
used previous exponential model and had the AI change it by writing out what I wanted
trial and error, had to make it not run infinintly finally go the graph
then we had to acount for intraspecific competition with the shading
changed it back to an exponential model because the logistic wasnt workign and teh handbook said they were doing exponential, also just made dN_0 = 0.4 * N_0
graphed that but didnt feellike making it look nicer by limiting teh days
then to find how long it takes to even out and the total plants I had teh chatbot write the code

IC_Inclassexample2 
imported Population_Data.csv and created a graph from it
used copilot inline editor to enhance the grpah: added points, changed line color, grid lines
found the carrying capacity then added it as a dotted line on the graph

IC_assignment4
created a Lotka-volterra competition model for interspecific competion between species N graphed in IC_assignment3 and a new species M, which is threatend.
changed the code around to add for species M then used copilot to edit my graph code.
the plot shows How N keeps growing and M declines. made a description for the grpah with that
found what day M population reaches 0, which is when it is less than one because you cant have a percentage of a plant.
then added in teh competition coefficient in a markdown box to work of off next week. ansered question 3: at what point does alpha need to be for both to coexist, answer in handbook.

IC_inclassexample3
first we took teh graph from assignemtn4 and messed around to see if we could keep the threatend species, didnt matter because of carrying capacity.

after this incorborated alpha adn beta into equation.
messed around with what they equal to change graph.
learned how we could simplify the graph with x* adn y*, didnt actually incorporate that in though.
