# BIO_350
first one idk
starting out BIO350 assignments repo

IC Assignment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook
- making a difference equation
-technical difficulties
-it worked thank god

IC_assignment 2: chapter 2 of ecology handbook
-making an exponential equation
-so many technical difficulties
just coppied enya
did matplotlib adn plotting on x and y axis

IC-in class
did a log on the previous assignmetn 
then did if for function
messed aroudn with the graph of that

IC_assignment3
created a logistic model for the chances of plants gowing after lanslide
used previous exponential model and had the AI change it by writing out what I wanted
trial and error, had to make it not run infinintly finally go the graph
then we had to acount for intraspecific competition with the shading
changed it back to an exponential model because the logistic wasnt workign and teh handbook said they were doing exponential, also just made dN_0 = 0.4 * N_0
graphed that but didnt feellike making it look nicer by limiting teh days
then to find how long it takes to even out and the total plants I had teh chatbot write the code
